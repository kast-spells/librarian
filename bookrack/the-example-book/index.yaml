chapters:
  - intro       # Infrastructure foundation (Istio, Cert-Manager, ArgoCD)
  - services    # Application workloads
  - others      # Additional components (Storage, etc.)

# Note: Lexicon entries for infrastructure resources (gateways, issuers, etc.)
# are defined in the spells that create those resources, not here.
# This keeps the book index clean and follows the principle that resources
# should register themselves in the lexicon where they are created.
